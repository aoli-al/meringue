# Meringue

Meringue is a Maven plugin for running and analyzing fuzzing campaigns.

## Requirements

* Java Development Kit 8+
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.6.0+

## Building Meringue

1. Ensure that some version of OpenJDK 8+ is installed.
2. Set the JAVA_HOME environmental variable to the path to this installation. For example, on Mac,
   run `export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_222-openjdk/Contents/Home/`.
3. Clone or download this repository.
4. In the root directory for this project, run `mvn -DskipTests install`.

## Adding Meringue to Your Build
To add Meringue to your build add the meringue-maven-plugin in your pom:
   ```
   <build>
       ...
       <plugins>
           ...
           <plugin>
              <groupId>edu.neu.ccs.prl.meringue</groupId>
              <artifactId>meringue-maven-plugin</artifactId>
              <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
           </plugin>
           ...
       </plugins>
       ...
   </build>
   ```

## Running a Fuzzing Campaign
To run a fuzzing campaign use Meringue's fuzz goal:

```
mvn meringue:fuzz
-Dmeringue.testClass=<C> 
-Dmeringue.testMethod=<M>
[-Dmeringue.duration=<D>]
[-Dmeringue.outputDirectory=<O>]
[-Dmeringue.javaOptions=<P>]
```

Where:

* \<C\> is the fully-qualified name of the test class.
* \<M\> is the name of the test method.
* \<D\> is the maximum amount of time to execute the fuzzing campaign for specified in the ISO-8601 duration format (
  e.g., 2 days, 3 hours, and 4 minutes is "P2DT3H4M"). The default value is one day.
* \<O\> is the path of the directory to which the output files should be written.
  The default value is ${project.build.directory}/meringue.
* \<P\> is a list of Java command line options that should be used for test JVMs.

## Analyzing a Fuzzing Campaign

To analyze a fuzzing campaign use Meringue's analyze goal:

```
mvn meringue:analyze
-Dmeringue.testClass=<C> 
-Dmeringue.testMethod=<M>
[-Dmeringue.duration=<D>]
[-Dmeringue.outputDirectory=<O>]
[-Dmeringue.javaOptions=<P>]
[-Dmeringue.maxTraceSize=<Z>]
[-Dmeringue.debug]
[-Dmeringue.timeout=<Y>]
[-Dmeringue.jacocoFormats=<F>]
```

Where:

* \<C\> is the fully-qualified name of the test class.
* \<M\> is the name of the test method.
* \<D\> is the maximum amount of time to execute the fuzzing campaign for specified in the ISO-8601 duration format (
  e.g., 2 days, 3 hours, and 4 minutes is "P2DT3H4M"). The default value is one day.
* \<O\> is the path of the directory to which the output files should be written.
  The default value is ${project.build.directory}/meringue.
* \<P\> is a list of Java command line options that should be used for test JVMs.
* \<Z\> is the maximum number of frames to include in stack traces taken for failures. By default, a maximum of 5 frames
  are included.
* The presence of -Dmeringue.debug indicates that forked analysis JVMs should suspend and wait for a debugger to attach
  on port 5005. By default, forked analysis JVMs do not suspend and wait for a debugger to attach.
* \<Y\> is the maximum amount of time in seconds to execute a single input during analysis or -1 if no timeout should be
  used. By default, a timeout value of 600 seconds is used.
* \<F\> is a list of JaCoCo report formats to be generated. The formats XML, HTML, CSV are supported. By default, all
  formats are generated.

During its analysis, Meringue will rerun the inputs that were saved during the campaign to produce a
JaCoCo coverage report and a report listing observed failures.

## Running Examples

The following instructions assume that you have already built Meringue according to the above instructions.
To run an example fuzzing campaign run:

```
mvn -fmeringue-examples -P<FRAMEWORK>,<SUBJECT> verify
```

Where:

* \<FRAMEWORK\> is one of the following: "zest" or "jazzer"
* \<SUBJECT\> is one of the following: "ant", "maven", "bcel", "closure", or "rhino"

When the fuzzing campaign has completed, Meringue will rerun the inputs that were saved during the campaign to produce a
JaCoCo coverage report and a report listing observed failures.
